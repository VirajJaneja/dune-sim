<h1>Dune Sim</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is essentially a simulation of the landscape from Frank Herbert's dune. The program consists of a simulation of the sandy surface and underground of arrakis, populated by sound-sensitive sandworms. The project provides the ability to create sound via thumper, and create/manipulate terrain. This utilizes a pathfinding algorithm.
